# Pluto
Pluto is a Terraria server written in java that aims to be optimized, simple, and scalable.
The core reason for this being made is to improve performance and create a well documented
and easy to use api for creating server side plugins for Terraria.

This obviously isn't going to be an easy endeavor, however I personally believe that the
returns will be worth the hard work. I encourage you to look through the code, most of it
should be well documented.
